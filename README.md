# Landing Page

This is my project about my a business meant to make people quit smoking via a product that replaces smoking with something healthier. This is an obviously stupid business idea, but I just want to make up a random product so I can practice my web-development skills and apply them elsewhere. Feel free to look through my code. Cheers!
